Store block with women's clothing. 
The project is made on React and is divided into components that include separate elements of the page and the corresponding styles to them. The block of the website includes a slider made using new technologies CSS and JavaScript. 
The switches are implemented by stylizing radio buttons and using the useState component. 
The zoommer is made on CSS and JS in such a way that when you hover over the slide, its transparency becomes 0 and we see a larger background. With the help of React useState, the mouse movement is tracked, thanks to which we can move around the background. 

Enjoy watching :)
